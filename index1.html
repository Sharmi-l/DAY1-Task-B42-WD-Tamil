    <br>
     <h4><i>DEFINITION:</i></h4>
        <p>In JavaScript, an object is a <b>standalone entity, with properties and type</b>. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A <b>cup</b> has<i> a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of,</i> etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</p>
        <p>These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).</p>
    <h4><i>OBJECT REPRESENTATION:</i></h4>
        <p>An object can be created with <b>figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties.</b> A property is a <b>“key: value”</b> pair, where a key is a string (also called a <b>“property name”</b>), and value can be anything. Let us visualize this with the following syntax for creating an object in JavaScript.</p>
    <h4><i>OBJECT TYPE IN JAVASCRIPT:</i></h4>
     <p>An object type is simply a <b>collection of properties in the form of name and value pairs</b>. Notice from the list that null and undefined are primitive JavaScript data types, each being a data type containing just one value.</p>
    <h4>In JavaScript, there are four methods to use to create an object:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Object Literals.</li>
        <li>New operator or constructor.</li>
        <li>Object.create method.</li>
        <li>Class.</li>   
    </ol>
    <h4>Objects and properties:</h4>
    <p>A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.<i>You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
        </i>
       <b> objectName.propertyName</b>
        </p>
    <h4>How to create an object:</h4>
    <h4>We can create an objects in 2 ways:</h4>
    <p><u>Example for way1 (Single line):</u> </p>
    <p><b>const person = {
        firstName: "Sharmi",
        lastName: "Vasu",
        age:29,
        gender: "Female"
      };</b>
      </p>
       
    <h4> <u>Example for way2 (multiple lines):</u></h4>
    
     <p><i>const person = {</i></p>
     <p><i> firstName: "Sharmi",</i></p>
     <p><i>lastName: "Vasu",</i></p>
    <p><i>age:29,</i></p>
     <p><i> gender: "Female"</i></p>
    <p><i> };</i></p>
